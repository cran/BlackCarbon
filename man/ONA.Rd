\title{ Optimized Noise Reduction Averaging (ONA) algorithm
  %%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
  The function uses the Optimized Noise Reduction Averaging (ONA) algorithm to process the raw black carbon data collected by Aethalometers (MicroAeth AE51, AethLabs, CA, USA).The algorithm smooths the black carbon concentration over a varying smoothing window identified by change in coefficient of light attenuation (ATN).
  %%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
  ONA(data=data, ATN = "ATN", BC ="BC", dATN =0.05)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{ it is a datafram generated by the AE51 device at the file level and not compiled with other files, however, a little pre-processing has to be done such as naming the columns and formatting it as a data frame.
    %%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
  }
  \item{ATN}{
the column having ATN coefficient.
    %%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
  }
  \item{BC}{
the column having raw black carbon data.
    %%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
  }
  \item{dATN}{the difference in ATN coefficient which is used for defining the averaging window of raw black carbon concentration, by default it is 0.05.
    %%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
  }
}
\details{

  This method is only applicable when the raw files are not compiled
  %%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{

  The default method returns a vector with equal length as the dataframe
  %%  ~Describe the value returned
  %%  If it is a LIST, use
  %%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
  %%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
  %% ...
